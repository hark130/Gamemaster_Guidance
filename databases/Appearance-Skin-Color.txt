# Skin – Color
# Copied from: https://www.bryndonovan.com/2015/06/16/master-list-of-physical-descriptions/
# Josh Roby made this great chart of skin tones and descriptor words, and I got a lot of these words from him.
# The quote from N.K. Jemisin interested me: “I get really tired of seeing African-descended characters
# described in terms of the goods that drove, and still drive, the slave trade–coffee, chocolate, brown sugar.
# There’s some weird psychosocial baggage attached to that.”
