# Class often inspires how Keleshites grant names. Lower-class
# Keleshites draw from the horse cultures of central Casmaron
# alongside their clan and family names, while important and
# wealthy Keleshites use a single name derived from imperial Kelesh.
#
# Keleshite names can also be influenced by their traditional
# culture. Most who have no strong connection to a founding
# culture follow the conventions of the Althameri: a first
# name followed by a matronymic, with the prefix al- (such
# as Yaqib al-Marah, meaning "Yaqib, son of Marah"). When more
# specific identification is necessary, Althameri names can also
# include an ancestor, while in formal situations a tribal name,
# merchant house, noble family name, religious temple name, and
# home city might also be included (such as Yaqib al-marah Tiferi
# Bekhzadi Al-Hiraf, or Yaqib, son of Marah, a member of the
# Tiferi tribe and Bekhzadi merchant house, from Al-Hiraf).
# Members of the imperial family use the family name al-Parishat,
# with other names representing their branch of the family.
