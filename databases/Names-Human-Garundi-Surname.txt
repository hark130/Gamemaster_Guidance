# Garundi names are used to define both the territory claimed
# by the clan and the individual’s place in the local hierarchy.
# Those at the top of the hierarchy have names that span the
# entirety of the territory – the name of the city, geographic
# region, or a nearby major river or mountain. Mid-ranking Garundi
# are named after sites, geographic features, or buildings known
# to most locals – waterfalls, neighborhoods, or important local
# industry. Low-standing clan members have names of local sites
# (often from near where they were born – streets, statues, trees.
